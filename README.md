=======

This is a very reduced version of Vladimir Agafonkin's SunCalc library (https://github.com/mourner/suncalc).

A clone for shadow calculation of OSM Buildings. Contains code from getPosition() only.

--

SunCalc is a tiny BSD-licensed JavaScript library for calculating sun position,
sunlight phases (times for sunrise, sunset, dusk, etc.),
moon position and lunar phase for the given location and time,
created by [Vladimir Agafonkin](http://agafonkin.com/en) ([@mourner](https://github.com/mourner))
as a part of the [SunCalc.net project](http://suncalc.net).

Most calculations are based on the formulas given in the excellent Astronomy Answers articles
about [position of the sun](http://aa.quae.nl/en/reken/zonpositie.html)
and [the planets](http://aa.quae.nl/en/reken/hemelpositie.html).
You can read about different twilight phases calculated by SunCalc
in the [Twilight article on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight).


## Usage

```javascript
suncalc(timeAndDate, latitude, longitude)
```
Returns an object with the following properties:

 * `altitude`: sun altitude above the horizon in radians,
 e.g. `0` at the horizon and `PI/2` at the zenith (straight over your head)
 * `azimuth`: sun azimuth in radians (direction along the horizon, measured from south to west),
 e.g. `0` is south and `Math.PI * 3/4` is northwest
